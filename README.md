# RFIS
RPM Fusion Install Script (RFIS) 
For use with ***FEDORA SYSTEMS ONLY***

# How to use RFIS?
Download the script from the releases page and run it with ``sudo bash RFIS.sh`` but do not worry, if you forget sudo it will request it for you.

# What does this do?
Simple. Installs RPM Fusion repo, and does all multimedia steps, so you don't have to.

# There was a problem. How do I report it?
Report it in https://github.com/sgeuthecodingcat/RFIS/issues 

# There's a problem in the script and I want to contribute.
Edit it in Github and submit a pull request.
https://github.com/sgeuthecodingcat/RFIS/pulls

# It's taking so long to get my PR accepted, or Issue read!
There's only one contributor here. Give me a week or so, I read 5 PRs and 5 Issues each week and will probably comment on it.

# When will it be compatible with RHEL, CentOS, or AlmaLinux?
If there is enough demand, I will copple one together within a week or two.
