Download the script from the releases page and run it with ``sudo bash RFIS.sh``

Simple. Installs RPM Fusion repo, and does all multimedia steps, so you don't have to.

# It's taking so long to get my PR accepted, or Issue read!
There's only one contributor here. Give me a week or so, I read 5 PRs and 5 Issues each week and will probably comment on it once I read it.

# Where are the testing releases?
Usually on pre-release on the releases tab, also source code is in the "testing-branch" branch

# When will it be compatible with RHEL, CentOS, or AlmaLinux?
If there is enough demand, I will copple one together within a week or two.
